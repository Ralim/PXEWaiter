# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this package generally just wraps other projects, keeping on the latest release is reccomended.
Dependabot _should_ keep these up to date for us, so versions should occur whenever required.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest   | :white_check_mark: |
| <latest   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please open a github issue ASAP, will aim to have a response as soon as humanly possible.
